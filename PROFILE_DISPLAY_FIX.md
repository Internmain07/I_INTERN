# Profile Display Fix - Skills, Name & Work Experience

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Skills showing as "No skills added yet" on dashboard
**Cause:** The `/auth/me` endpoint was returning User model directly without student_profile data

**Fix:** Updated `/auth/me` endpoint to:
- Query `student_profiles` table
- Return skills as array from student_profile
- Include all student profile fields

### 2. ❌ Name showing as "Deepakumars700" instead of full name
**Cause:** Frontend using username/email instead of `full_name` field

**Fix:** Updated `/auth/me` endpoint to return `full_name` as `name` field

### 3. ❌ Work Experience not showing in applicant details
**Cause:** SQLAlchemy relationships not being properly loaded

**Fix:** Changed to direct database queries:
- Query `work_experiences` table directly using `user_id`
- Query `projects` table directly using `user_id`
- Applied to both endpoints:
  - `/applications/company/all-applicants`
  - `/applications/applicant/{application_id}`

## Files Changed

### 1. `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py`
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/auth/me`

**Changes:**
```python
# Before: Returned User model directly
return current_user

# After: Builds complete response with student profile data
- Queries student_profiles table
- Returns skills as array
- Returns full_name as name
- Includes all education, bio, links, etc.
```

### 2. `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/applications.py`
**Endpoints:** 
- `GET /api/v1/applications/company/all-applicants`
- `GET /api/v1/applications/applicant/{application_id}`

**Changes:**
```python
# Before: Used relationships
for exp in student.work_experiences:
    work_experiences.append(...)

# After: Direct database query
work_experiences_query = db.query(WorkExperience).filter(
    WorkExperience.user_id == student.id
).all()

for exp in work_experiences_query:
    work_experiences.append(...)
```

### 3. `backend/app/schemas/user.py`
**Changes:**
```python
# Before
skills: Optional[str] = None

# After
skills: Optional[List[str]] = None  # Now a list!
```

### 4. `backend/app/models/profile.py`
**Changes:**
```python
# Added safety flag
__table_args__ = {'extend_existing': True}
```

## Testing

### 1. Test Dashboard Display (Student View)

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/auth/me`

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "email": "deepakumars700@gmail.com",
  "role": "intern",
  "name": "Deepak Kumar",  // ← Should show full name now
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "skills": ["react", "java", "python"],  // ← Should be array
  "university": "IIT Delhi",
  "major": "Computer Science",
  "graduation_year": "2025",
  "bio": "Your bio...",
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Frontend should show:**
- ✅ Full name instead of "Deepakumars700"
- ✅ Skills as tags: `react`, `java`, `python`
- ✅ University and major

### 2. Test Applicant Details (Company View)

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/applications/applicant/{application_id}`

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "application_id": "...",
  "name": "Deepak Kumar",
  "university": "IIT Delhi",
  "major": "Computer Science",
  "skills": ["react", "java", "python"],
  "work_experiences": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "company": "Company Name",
      "position": "Software Engineer",
      "start_date": "2023-01-01",
      "end_date": "2024-01-01",
      "description": "Job description..."
    }
  ],
  "projects": [...],
  "education": {...}
}
```

**Frontend should show:**
- ✅ Education section with university, major, graduation year
- ✅ Work Experience section with all entries
- ✅ Technical Skills section with skill tags
- ✅ Full name

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Restart Backend Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2. Clear Browser Cache
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or clear browser cache completely

### 3. Test Endpoints

**Test 1: Check your profile data**
```bash
# Login first
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"deepakumars700@gmail.com","password":"YOUR_PASSWORD"}'

# Get token and use it
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Expected:** Should see your full name, skills array, university, etc.

**Test 2: Check work experience data (run the debug script)**
```bash
cd backend
python debug_user_data.py
```

**Expected:** Should list all your work experiences from the database

**Test 3: View as company**
- Login as company
- View applicants
- Click on your application
- Should see complete profile with work experience

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Skills still not showing
**Solution:** 
1. Make sure skills are saved as JSON array in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT skills FROM student_profiles WHERE user_id = YOUR_USER_ID;
   -- Should show: ["react", "java", "python"]
   ```
2. If not, update your profile again through the UI

### Issue: Work Experience still empty
**Solution:**
1. Check if work experiences exist:
   ```bash
   python debug_user_data.py
   ```
2. If entries exist but not showing:
   - Restart backend server
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Name still shows as email
**Solution:**
1. Update your full_name:
   ```bash
   PUT /api/v1/users/profile
   {
     "full_name": "Your Full Name"
   }
   ```
2. Refresh the page
