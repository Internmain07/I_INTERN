# Student Application Details Fix - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Offer Status Not Persisting (Previous Issue)**
**Problem:** When an employer sent an offer to a student, the status would show "Offered" initially, but after refreshing the page, it would revert to "Applied".

**Root Cause:** The `Dashboard.tsx` page's `handleStatusUpdate` function was only updating the local React state without calling the API to persist changes to the database.

**Solution:**
- Updated `frontend/src/apps/company-dashboard/pages/Dashboard.tsx`:
  - Made `handleStatusUpdate` an `async` function
  - Added API call to `applicationService.updateApplicationStatus()` before updating local state
  - Added proper error handling with try-catch blocks
  - Added debugging console logs for troubleshooting

- Updated `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/applications.py`:
  - Added comprehensive debugging logs in the `update_application_status` endpoint
  - Added proper error handling with database rollback on failure
  - Fixed duplicate entry in canonical_map ('offer_sent' was listed twice)
  - Added 'under_review' to the canonical mapping

### 2. **Student Profile Information Not Showing (Current Issue)**
**Problem:** When students viewed their application details, the Education, Work Experience, and Technical Skills sections showed "Not specified" or "No information available" even though the student had filled out their profile.

**Root Cause:** The `/api/v1/applications/my-applications` endpoint only returned internship-related information and did not include the student's profile data (education, work experience, projects, skills).

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### Backend Changes (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/applications.py`)

Updated the `get_my_applications` endpoint to include:
1. **Student Profile Information:**
   - University
   - Major/Field of Study
   - Graduation Year
   - Grading Type & Score
   - Bio
   - Skills (normalized as array)

2. **Work Experiences:**
   - Company, Position
   - Start and End dates
   - Description

3. **Projects:**
   - Title, Description
   - Technologies (as array)
   - Start and End dates
   - GitHub URL and Live Demo URL

The endpoint now queries the student's profile data once and includes it in each application response, avoiding repeated database queries.

#### Frontend Changes

**1. Created New Component:** `frontend/src/apps/interns-dashboard/components/StudentApplicationDetailsModal.tsx`
- Beautiful modal component with gradient header matching the app theme
- Sections for:
  - **Application Information**: Date, Status, Position, Company, Location, Stipend, Duration
  - **Education**: University, Major, Graduation Year, GPA/CGPA
  - **Work Experience**: Full details with company, position, dates, description
  - **Projects**: Title, description, technologies, links to GitHub/Live Demo
  - **Technical Skills**: Displayed as badges

**2. Updated Component:** `frontend/src/apps/interns-dashboard/pages/ApplicationsPage.tsx`
- Added state management for modal and selected application
- Made application cards clickable to open the details modal
- Updated Application interface to include:
  - `student_profile` object
  - `work_experiences` array
  - `projects` array
